# Lab | Good Practices

## Goals
The goal of this lab is to define good practices that you and your team will follow during your third project.

## Instructions
* Fork this repo. 
* Debate about your code styling with your team.
* Do some agreements on the topics below.
* Create a `.md` file that describes the good practices you defined. Add the file to your repository and submit it by doing a pull request.  
* Follow your agreements during the project!

## Topics
* Variable naming.
According to 'Code Etiquette', when naming variables, it's always better to be explicit than implicit, for one is not writing codes for oneself but others to read. Naming variables properly in a consistent format helps whoever reads those codes later to better understand. 

Although there is no official rules


Flat is better than nested. Flat structure let you read your code with higher efficiency. You can easily say what is going on with your variable or in which iteration you receive an error if your code is flat.
Sparse is better than dense. Remember about indentation and keep space between different blocks of code. NEVER stick too much code on one line.
Readability counts. Respect your reader/viewer/reviewer.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. Keep in mind, no except is allowed to break your code. From other side, be consistent with general coding rules (keep in mind that someone not really familiar with Python might read your code).
Although practicality beats purity. Still sometimes exceptions from general rule are fine.
Errors should never pass silently. Never let errors, which may occur, confuse the reader. This may easily be resolved by printing a string when an error occurs.
Unless explicitly silenced. If you now about the error in the code, it should be well processed and not break the code. User should have the best experience - show that you are aware of this error by correct message.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. Never give a chance to interpret your code differently. If you give a choice to user, it should be guided choice, not random.
There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it. Eliminate confusion. If you expect DD-MM-YYYY format of date as input, do not allow any other input formats.
Now is better than never. Even if better late than never, it is clearly better now than later. Do today what others won’t do. Do tomorrow what others can’t do.
Although never is often better than right now. When a solution comes to your mind, it is better not to implement right away. Take your idea down, do something else, and come back to reflect on your idea. Because it is easy for people to be blinded by the task at hand. You need to change your perspective and think from other angles. Implement your solution only if you trust it is the right one. Don't rush to do a quick hack.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. Think twice before actually running the code. Can't explain the solution to your grandmother? Okay, not grandma, but your group mate - skip the solution. Or at least try to restructure it. Remember rules 3 and 4.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. But anyway, some ideas are just bad, regardless of whether they are easy to implement or not.
Namespaces are one honking great idea. Classes are awesome. Once clearly defined, with all the rules and methods they become understandable for any user.
Debugging
* Function naming.

* Libraries.

* Community conventions.

* Git
